# Promise APIs Comparison

## Introduction
In JavaScript, promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. There are four main types of promise APIs: `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.race`, and `Promise.any`. Understanding the differences between these APIs is crucial for effectively managing asynchronous tasks.

## 1. Promise.all
- Resolves when all promises in the iterable argument have resolved.
- Rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejects.
- Returns a single promise that resolves with an array of results from all the input promises.

## 2. Promise.allSettled
- Resolves after all of the given promises have either resolved or rejected.
- Returns a promise that resolves with an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise.

## 3. Promise.race
- Resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects.
- Returns a promise that resolves or rejects with the value or reason from the first resolved or rejected promise.

## 4. Promise.any
- Resolves as soon as any of the promises in the iterable resolves.
- Rejects if all of the promises reject.
- Returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first resolved promise or rejects with an AggregateError if all promises are rejected.

## Comparison
- `Promise.all`: Resolves when all promises fulfill.
- `Promise.allSettled`: Resolves after all promises are settled, regardless of their outcome.
- `Promise.race`: Resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise settles.
- `Promise.any`: Resolves as soon as any promise fulfills.

Understanding the behavior and use cases of each of these APIs is essential for writing efficient and robust asynchronous JavaScript code.
